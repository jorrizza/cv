## Introduction ##

Starting out with an old Philips MSX II as a kid, and writing software ever
since. Started using Linux in 2000 and haven't looked back. A fierce advocate of
open-source software, digital rights, and operational security. Interested in
everything software-related, from architecture and development, to operations
and availability. Definitely a soft spot for well-designed distributed systems.

Throughout my work, my leading philosophy is "keep it simple".
