Running my own company doing pretty much all sorts of IT-related work. Mainly
DevOps related.

Managed and executed the construction of a development and hosting platform,
hardware and all, for our in-house Ruby on Rails application. Main components
include Debian, Nginx, Ruby, HAProxy, Nagios/Icinga and PostgreSQL. I've also
built parts of the application, including a nifty ajaxy search engine.

### *2011-2012:* IT Consultant at *ViaViela B.V.* ###

Kept the e-Viela! LNMP stack running. Managed a large VPN (OpenBSD, Tinc) for

development as well. Mainly Ruby on Rails and PHP.

### *2006-2010:* Software Engineer at *e-Viela! B.V.* ###

F/LOSS based software solutions for medium to big sized organizations. I've
helped building one of the most awesome LAMP stacks in the world. Mainly using
Debian GNU/Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, DRBD and Heartbeat2. The entire stack has
been migrated to Nginx. I've helped introduce Linux desktops (NX) into the
company. This company's activities have been merged into ViaViela B.V. in 2011.

### *2004-2008:* Software Engineer at *Eurovision Multimedia* ###

Made them a web shop which integrated with existing sales software using PHP,
